### Hunter
A ressurector of contracts that selfdestruct() in the void.  The Hunter draws an Arrow, takes aim at a Cloud, and shoots.  An instantaneous flash in the Cloud, gone as quickly as it is create2ed, but long enough to carry out mission critical intructions.

### Arrow
An arrow made of bytecode that never misses it's intended target.

### Cloud
A smart contract address that's deterministically pre-computed but has no contract deployed to it. Also known as a lazy, counterfactual, wallet contract. It's address is determined in part by both the Hunter and the Arrow. Tokens, NFT's, and Ether can be sent to this Cloud of pure nothingness.

### Quiver
A registry of Arrows.

Step 1.
Deploy Quiver.

Step 2.
Deploy Hunter.

Step 3.
seek() - Based on the Hunter's address, the Arrow used, and user defined salt, the perfect Cloud is found.

Step 4.
shoot() - After the user has sent in funds or done whatever is needed with the cloud address, a
contract is create2ed in the cloud which then carries out instructions before selfdestruct()ing.

Step 5.
Profit.
